      <div id = 'content' class=""><h4>The following is a prisoners uncensored unedited awnsers to questions posed by students learning about the prison system. 
          <br>
          I hope reading this will show the huaminty, intelect, value, and redeemabilty of those contained within our prisons as it did for me.
          </h4>
          From: Maxwell<br>
 If incarceration itself is inhumane then solitary confinement has no definition. Upon arrival in solitary you realize that there is absolutely nothing in the cell and that is pretty much the case for the remainder of your stay. Your sense of time begins to be distorted. At times you will find yourself using a lot of "self talk", or maybe I mean just talking to yourself. For some reason you are more hungry than usual but maybe that is because the meal trays seem to be smaller.<br>
        Humans are by nature social beings and the most human thing is removed from the equation, and that is human interaction. Never mind all the trauma and stress you have been exposed to before arriving in solitary. If you do not consider yourself mentally sound or strong solitary will consume you. The only thing that helped me in this situation was my ability to write music and poetry. Without music and poetry my mental health would be in desperate need of attention. I believe solitary traumatizes individuals who are already severely traumatized. The inhumaneness of solitary confinement makes people believe and behave like they are not human, and the worst part about it is that some do not ever realize it. Picture creatures playing in feces, banging on cages, and making noise until fatigue sets in. What do you see? Is it a zoo or can you see solitary? I can tell you from experience that the difference is the faces. Faces of people, just like you and I.<br>
