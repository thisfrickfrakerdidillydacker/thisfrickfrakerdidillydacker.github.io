From Angel Perralta<br>

It would be my honor and privilege to shed some light on my experiences while in prison to help with the project your students are working on, I'll be honest with you, and feel free to use what you feel will help you in this project.<br>
<br>
Questions from Abigail and Grace....<br>
<br>
I would like to say that mental health illness is a big factor for many incarcerated people, whether they come to prison with this illness or develop mental heath problems over time do to the day to day living conditions and the emotional rollercoaster one go's through by being separated from loved ones for so many years is a problem that can't simply be ignored, to ignore or to disregard this illness is to put the public safety at greater risk when that person is finally released back into society.<br>
<br>
For me my mental health has not been affected while I've been incarcerated, I learned early on in my prison sentence that I had to block out a lot of the things that I had no control over out there in the real world while adjusting and adapting to a life behind these cold walls in order for me to focus on the fundamental things that where within my control while incarcerated, like participating in programs that where going to help me change how my thoughts, feelings and beliefs affected my actions that lead me to living such a reckless lifestyle which contributed to the harm I caused to my victims and my community as a whole and the ripple effect it had on my loved ones. That drive I had to stay focused helped me stay sane when my whole world around me seemed like it was crumbling. Its by the grace of God and my will to leave prison a better man that has brought me a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me.<br>
<br>
I've met only one person that I can think of that suffered from mental health issues, and it was sad to see this person in prison acting so outside the norm and acting like a crazy person, it seemed like he didn't have no control over his mental state of mind, and tho I would see him go and take medication, to me it didn't seem like they was doing him any good. The sad reality about prison is, that man was treated like dirt by almost everybody, he acted like a fool so he could get attention all day everyday, in his mind he thought people where laughing with him not fully comprehending that people where laughing at him, and egging him on to doing things a normal person wouldn't do, things they wouldn't do themselves, Like taking off his dirty adult diaper and running around the prison unit waving it around in the air over his head while everybody laughed. We call that, recreation in prison, getting laughs at another mans expense, which is so wrong when the person doesn't even realise what he's doing. The truth is so many people are desensitized in prison to the reality of mental health and that kind of mentality needs to change for inmates and staff alike, if you see something you need to say something, no one should just stand aside and watch a person degrade themselves like that, so my view is, its on everybody to have common decency toward our fellow man or woman to do what's morally right and be apart of the solution and not the problem even if where in prison or out there in society, where all human at the end of the day and need to be mindful of the fact that "you'll never know if one day that person might be you in the future or someone you love that's within your own family"<br>
<br>
You see how that last sentence gives you pause,which cause's you to think about how you should treat others so that you in turn in your greatest need will hope that someone else will show you compassion and respect when your at your greatest need.
Sometimes people in prison and society are blind to that fact and this simple truth,"that what go's around comes around full circle" so every move you make, and every word you say, should be considered more carefully so that you can lead a more for filling life and help someone else who hasn't the right mental mindset to understand what is actually going on around them.<br>
<br>
I am grateful to help you out with this project, but the real issue surrounding prison mental health can not be limited to this environment for which we live in, you have to try and understand why society feels the need to forget about people who are in prison, why there is no accountability when it comes to real prison reforms and why there isn't more programs in prison that deal with the mental health the aspect of incarceration, lobbyist, congressman and senator's are all responsible for making sure that the money the department of corrections are getting each and every year, be put to use in insuring that people in prison get the rehabilitation and the help they need in order to safeguard public safety upon that inmate's release.<br>
<br>
You have to follow the money that's within the yearly prison budget to understand why the funds are being used for more security purposes, instead of rehabilitation and treatment for individuals who can benefit  from more therapy and programming dedicated towards the mental health of incarcerated individuals and why there isn't more oversight with the funds that are supposed to go into the treatment aspect of incarceration. It would strengthen your project to get answers from those who are put in office by us the people, they take a oath to serve and protect, you can call and contact these senator's and congressman to try and see if they can shed some light on these points and incorporate there responses into your project so that you may hold them responsible while also creating change within the prison system. <br>
<br>
See this opportunity in doing this project to create change in this world, use your platform to start the conversations about the real issue that plague's our society and hold people accountable because this is your future that can be more promising if more people speak up about the mental health pandemic that is rooted in our society.<br>
<br>
There is a saying that the president can create great change by one stroke of his pen. But this saying is also true "you can be that pebble thrown in the still waters of a pond which is our society that can have the ripple effects to create great change"<br>
<br>
I think people who suffer from mental health should be put in a hospital that focuses on patients who have mental health issues so that they can get the proper care and attention they deserve and need, without proper treatment a person will have no real chance at succeeding in there lives upon release.<br>
<br>
I think therapy in prison is a positive way of gaining true understanding about the issue's one needs to address in order to gain some sort of control over your emotional state of mind. Being able to have someone you can confide in without the chance of being judged can help that person find that peace of mind that plague's so many people who suffer from mental illness. Also the right medication geared toward helping these individuals instead of just pacifying them is needed to help them start having the tools they'll need and the building blocks in there lives that will help to create long term changes in there thought process.<br>
<br>
Questions from Leo...<br>
<br>
I think people in prison are treated certain ways based on how they act and treat other people around them. The thing about race in the prison population is that most ethnic races stay within there own social circles, to step outside that color circle might put you at risk of being alienated from your own race and being treated differently.( gender, lgbtq,religion etc.) Are all part of this prison culture, at the end of the day there's always going to be somebody who doesn't like you or treat you the way you think you should be treated while in prison, that's why theirs so many fights and misunderstandings due to the lack of respect and judging others, some people just want to be left in peace, others they want to find God and be apart a civil caring community within the prison system, others want to make meaningful changes in their lives and leave prison to never return again, while so many others won't learn nothing and be apart of the problem and not the solution moving forward in there lives, we who know better call this feeding the beast that only leads to a life time in prison. No matter what race you are or group you identity with, one thing is a fact, where all just prisoners waiting for the day we can breathe that fresh free air as a free man again. The real question is what will we as individuals do when we get that precious gift of freedom that so many people take for granted?????<br>
<br>
I think the staff and guards are in this position of power because they have taken the right steps in life to get them to where they are at today. Most will never be able to identify with our reality or identities because they never had to live our lifestyle but I do know of some who try to gain a understanding about the people they are here to oversee, a lot of them are respectful and are just here to earn a living to support there families. And then there's others who use there power of authority in unreasonable ways. I think the common thing that is stressed in prison is respect " treat people with respect so that you may avoid unnecessary misunderstandings"<br>
<br>
My day starts off by eating breakfast and getting ready for my institutional job, after that I come back from work and workout from 9am to 10:30 at 11:30 I eat lunch, 12:30 I go back to work for a half an hour 1pm to 2:30 I go for a two mile run in the yard and walk for the remainder of the timeI come back to the block eat some protein and take a shower, then I read my fantasy book by R.A Salvatore, that will take me to dinner time around 5pm, 6:20 I call my children, 8pm my TV shows start, 11:30pm is sleep time.<br>
<br>
To answer your question, I personally do not take medication.<br>
<br>
Where allowed to have one TV, one fan, one hot pot, clothes,pictures and paperwork, and food  we can purchase every week from commissary.<br>
<br>
I'am fortunate to have a single cell, I got this single cell by behaving good and staying out of trouble, you see there are rewards for good behavior and this living arrangement is my sanctuary and place of peace in an environment that can take a toll on your overall state of mind. Being in prison can be hard at times but its what you do in your rehabilitation process that can make it harder or easier to bare. You have to block out the noise and do what's best for you at the end of the day in order to have any chance at succeeding after you leave prison. Earlier in my sentence I did have cell mates and its not ideal to live in such a small space with another grown man, hygiene, cleanliness and attitudes and mannerisms can be the difference between living on edge or living in peace.<br>
<br>
These experiences in prison gives me all the strength I'll need to get out and live a more respectable lifestyle, so that I never again have to live in this prison environment.<br>
<br>
" Bad choices in life can never be undone after the fact,but the choices I make moving forward can bring me everlasting happiness "<br>
<br>
If someone is having a mental health crisis in solitary confinement they can ask a correctional officer to call a nurse to come assist them or they bring you to the hospital ward within the prison facility.<br>
<br>
What excites me the most about leaving prison is seeing my children, when I got locked up I never got to see my three children face to face, so being able to reunite with them after all these years of being apart will be a true blessing and something I will forever remember and hold dear to my heart.<br>
<br>
Maybe if your teacher is willing, she can go on my Facebook page and copy the letter I wrote to my children, and share it with you or the class so you can have a better understanding why this would mean so much to me, its a real long letter but something that holds so much meaning to me.<br>
<br>
Till the next time........<br>

Crazy right?baby sis was even there for that great day,not yet born but there nonetheless, we all had fun that night and like always you were the star of the show with your chunky baby cheeks having all the woman there saying how quite you were and feeding you all kinds of stuff, man I tell you this I could have had a million bucks and I still wouldn't have been able to steel your shine that night, I was the the most proudest father that night with so much to be greatful for ,and its crazy cause I don't know how you ate so much and where it all went being so little, but you was so happy that night, as was we all, if you look on my Facebook page you'll see in some of them pics of you it looks like a foreign place, that's because we were out there in D.R  I don't have any pics from the birthday but I'm a ask my father to find some so you can see what it looked like that night I would like to thank you my son because its  memories like that, that have helped me get through all these years. You see without you I would be lost,just a shell of a man abandoned by so many. So always remember how much you contributed to my overall wellbeing and true growth as a man while trapped behind these walls. I'll end by saying this, I love you my son, now & forever...............<br>
To my princess, you made my year today, you are the light that warms my soul and makes this stubborn mans heart melt within your hands just by the sound of your voice,I look forward to the future more so now then ever before, you and you brother made that so, for me and all it took for so much to change for me was both of your acceptance of me, I love you more then you can ever know and I hope that this feeling never gos away, my next post will be a memory of you baby girl so wait and we'll see where this journey takes us. Till the next time my princess I love you now & forever................<br>
