      <div id = 'content' class=""><h4>The following is a prisoners uncensored unedited awnsers to questions posed by students learning about the prison system. 
          <br>
          I hope reading this will show the huaminty, intelect, value, and redeemabilty of those contained within our prisons as it did for me.
          </h4>
          Hello Leo,<br>
<br>
     My name is Mark, and I have been incarcerated for the past thirteen years. A friend of mine received some questions you asked your teacher about prison, and provided me the opportunity to answer them. I am honored, Leo, to have this chance to respond to your studious and astute questions.<br>
     You asked a question about how different demographics of people are treated differently in prison, and well, I must say very differently. Although, before beginning, I have to be clear in that all incarcerated people are treated as though they are less than human. All incarcerated people are treated in ways that often violate their basic human rights, and in ways that do not acknowledge their basic human dignities. But as your question suggests, certain marginalized groups undergo further discriminations in prison. <br>
     One major discrepancy involves the treatment of Black and Brown skinned incarcerated people versus the treatment of white incarcerated people. The structures of racism are deeply embedded in our penal institutions, for even in here white privilege exists. <br>
     In prison there is something called a "security threat group" (STG), which is a status that is supposed to be reserved to classify dangerous 'inmates' involved in dangerous group activities, like gangs for instance. Often times, however, young Black and Latino men are labeled as a STG simply because of the neighborhoods they come from, not because of any negative activity they've committed in the institution. This, on the other hand, does not happen to white incarcerated people.
     Who gets labeled as a STG, and who doesn't is significant because of the ramifications of having the label. When a person is labeled as an STG it prevents them from being able to work the better institutional jobs, and systemically excludes them from being able to participate in rehabilitation programming. This, in turn, puts these nonwhite men in a disadvantageous position, that often leads to them recidivating upon release from prison because they were denied any meaningful opportunities or help while incarcerated.<br>
     Not to mention that nonwhite incarcerated people are adversely impacted by systemic racism prior to incarceration through underfunded schools that do not provide the same opportunities as white suburban schools. And education is associated with better job/career prospects, which means nonwhites are disadvantaged in the job market, which can lead to criminality. And once in prison, the refusal to help nonwhite incarcerated people compounds the problems they face in dealing with a racist society that did not provide them a fair and equal opportunity to succeed in the first place.     However, nonwhites are not the only group you mentioned that faces added discrimination in prison. The LGBTQ+ community is probably the most adversely influenced and shaped demographic, because they face the hatred of other incarcerated people, and that from the staff. I can not even imagine how hard it is for LGBTQ+ incarcerated people in prison.<br>
     Then you asked a really great question about whether or not correctional officers represent the identities of incarcerated people, and the answer is simply no. Approximately 50% of the Massachusetts' Department of Correction are nonwhite inmates, yet over 90% of correctional officers are white. <br>
     There is a really fancy academic term for this called, the political geography of incarceration. And what this term, and concept, points out is how the majority of incarcerated people come from poor nonwhite urban areas, yet the majority of our prisons are in white rural and suburban areas, and are staffed by white people from those areas. In this way, prisons, as a multi-billion dollar industry, are often analogized as a modern-day slave plantation. This analogy exists because prisons are full of poor nonwhite people who were often unemployed at the time when they committed their offenses, who were seen as a burden on society; but whom a for-profit industry has been built off of their confinement in prisons in white suburban and rural areas that function to employ white correctional officers. How different is this reality from slavery?
     It has been an honor answering these questions for you Leo, and I hope you continue to be inquisitive about the lives of marginalized people.<br>
<br>
Respectfully, <br>
Mark<br>
