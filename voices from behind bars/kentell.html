          From Kentell Weaver:
          <br><br>
          <br>
          <p class="tab">   </p>First of all, I would like to say I appreciate what your doing. I don't mind answering any of these questions because I feel like the stories behind these walls need to be heard, so I'll try to answer there questions as best as I can. I may only answer a few at a time because I'm also trying to get my own schoolwork done, but I got you. I'm in one of the college degree programs that they have here at Concord. Its a three year program for an associates degree. So far we've accumulated 50 credits, so we will officially be done at the end of this year. I should be home by next year to pursue my bachelors degree, but I'm just trying to take things one day at a time. 
          <br><br>
          This is just a little bit about me to give y'all an idea of my story. I won't go into the details of my case, but in 2003 I was arrested for murder at the age of 16. At the age of 18 I was sentenced to life in prison for the crime I committed. I've been to five different county jails and three different states prisons. Out of my 18 years in prison I've probably spent 3 of them in solitary confinement for various reasons. Sometime around 2013 or 14 they changed the laws in Massachusetts saying that a person who committed murder when they were a juvenile couldn't be sentenced to life in prison.  The immediately reduced my sentence changing it from a life sentence to 15 years to life so now I'm eligible for parole after 15 years. I seen parole in 2019 and they gave me a three year setback. I see them again next year, and I'm feeling super optimistic about getting it this time. People say that we're always more likely to get it the second time we go in front of the parole board, so I guess we'll see if that true when I cross that bridge. Oh, and if means anything I'm African American and I've grew up in Roxbury. I don't care if you tell the kids my name either. That's cool with me. I guess I'll answer some of the questions from these two first...

          Have you received mental health support while incarcerated?
          <br><br>
          In my opinion, the mental health services here are not the best. From my experience, its hard to talk to them because I find it impossible to vent to a random stranger who has no insight of the black experience. For that reason alone I don't feel comfortable divulging the details of my life because I know there's a level of understanding that they lack. When I'm struggling with any issues that I may be dealing with I confide in the people who I see as good friends. Those are the people who I feel are the most qualified to help me with whatever problems I may be wrestling with. These are people that have been in my shoes that give the most valuable advice. Without there support I don't know where I would be. And to be honest with you seeking mental health services in here has always had a stigma attached to it because people see that as a sign of weakness in here. So if I'm being real I can say that thought subconsciously lingered in the back of my mind making me reluctant to seek whatever help I may have needed from mental health. If I'm not around people that I can vent to whenever I'm stressed than I rather suffer in silence until I am.
          <br><br>
          How many people would you say you have met while incarcerated that suffer from mental illness?
          <br><br>
          I would say I've met a lot of people in here who are suffering from mental health issues. I can't really put a number to it because I don't feel like it will be able to quantify the amount of people that I feel suffer from it. I personally feel like we're all suffering from some form of mental health though. Whether it be on a micro scale or an extreme case there's so many ways in which this environment affects our mental health. A few examples: the way the DOC methodically goes out of their way to weaken or sometimes destroy the relationships that one may have with their loved ones, relying on drugs to help me to avoid having to deal with the consequences of my actions, feeling the guilt of my selfishness as whole while recognizing the collateral damage created in the process, the excessive harsh treatment from C.O's who take it upon themselves to make our sentences miserable because they feel like we are undeserving of a peaceful existence behind the bars, and the years of being isolated from the rest of civilization while continuously trying hard not to become one of the "walking dead". These are all things that can play a role in incrementally deteriorating an individuals mental state. To survive all this just means that even when I've finally obtained the freedom that I desire I'll still be haunted by the evils that I have endured. I'm pretty sure that's something that most people who have been incarcerated can relate to. Nobody leaves here the same though.
          <br><br>
          What do you think would be a better alternative for people who suffer from mental illness rather than go to prison or jail? 
          <br><br>
          I think when dealing with people with mental health issues there can't be a remedy that works as a one size fits all because I feel like every mental health case is unique to the individual. So there would have to be multiple courses of action for those in need of mental health services. I don't have a concrete idea of what I feel would be a better solution, but I know there are people who are passionate about mental health that are creative enough to construct more effective methods.
          <br><br>
          Have I ever had interactions with Crisis Intervention Teams?
          <br><br>
          I have never had any interactions with Crisis Intervention Teams because things like that are for the more severe mental health cases. So I can't give you any insight on that. (Sorry)
          <br><br>
          Do you believe that you and others who are incarcerated would benefit from regular therapy or counseling if you do not already have it?
          <br><br>
          I would personally say no as far as myself benefitting from the mental health services here, but I can't say that other people wouldn't benefit from the chance to have such access to "real" mental health treatment. My own experiences can't be accepted as the experience of the other 540 inmates that are here because their experiences may be different. So I don't want to speak for all. I actually have friends that rely on mental health here, and see them frequently. I've gotten mixed reviews on the treatment that they receive, but they all agree that mental health services here could be better. Big facts!
          <br><br>
          I'll send you some more answers throughout the day. These questions really made me think :)

          Leo’s Questions
          <br><br>
          How are people from different demographics treated differently (race, gender, lgbtq, religion, etc)?
          <br><br>
          One of the things I've noticed is that when it comes to classification (transfers to minimum security level prisons) people of color have more difficulties being transferred to minimum because of the hurdles that the put in front of us. They use these arbitrary and bias rules that keep people of color from being able to go to minimus and pre-releases. For example, one of the biggest things that i have a problem with here is something that they have called STG (Stategic Threat Group) which is just a pretentious jargon that the use to label us as gang members, but the majority of people in here labeled as "gang members" are people of color. Its a micro form of disenfranchisement because being labeled STG makes it difficult for you to get into certain programming, they use it against you to keep you from going to minimum and pre-release sometimes which would help you prepare for your re-entry back into society, and your STG status can be used against you to deny you of parole opportunities even when you are overly qualified for it. I find it disturbing that people of color are disproportionately affected by this micro disenfranchisement. I know people of color who have been intentionally labeled as STG when they have absolutely know ties to gang involvement, but I feel like shit like that is purposely done to create these impediments that these people of authority within this institution know will be detrimental to us in the long run. Its definitely premeditated on their part. Overall, people of color in are greeted with a different type of energy than white people. It would be ignorant to assume that white privilege doesn't exist within these spaces. I can really speak on the prejudices that gay or trans people face in here because I don't have enough interactions with gay or trans people to speak on it but one of my classmates in here is gay so next time I see him I will try to pick his brain and give you an answer to that question. As far as people of a certain religion dealing with the obstacles of institutional oppression I've seen first hand how Muslim brothers get treated in here, and they're met with a lot of resistance from administration when they're trying to get certain things done. When the Muslim brothers host "cultural events" (Juneteenth, Kwanzaa, Black History Month) here they move it to a part of the institution where it can be aggressively monitored. There's was a limit to the amount of people that they allowed to participate (45) in these events. So we did an experiment in here. We hosted an event through the Protestant services to see if there would be a difference in the restrictions placed on the event that we held. The difference in the amount of freedom that the gave us was ridiculous. There wasn't a cap on the amount of people that were allowed to attend, so the it was packed to capacity. Its the first time we hosted an event and they allowed people to just show up until no more people could fit in room. It was beautiful feeling because a lot of the time when we are restricted to only inviting 45 people to those cultural events people would always feel left out when they did not make the cut. So in a sense it would kind of pit us against each other because the people putting together the list for these events would show favoritism to other Muslims. So that in itself created a divide amongst us. When we did the event through Protestant services they never even inquired if we had a list of name for people who wanted to attend. They just let us do our thing. There wasnt even an officer in there watching the 100+ people who were crammed in the chapel. I'm usually involved on the small committees that help organize these events because I usually perform at them, so that's why I know so much about the headaches of trying to organize them. When I seen the freedom that they gave us during the event in the Protestant services in comparison to the way that they treated the Muslims brothers when they were in charge of organizing the events the differences were overwhelming. 
          <br><br>
          Do the staff and guards represent the identities of the people who are incarcerated?
          <br><br>
          I would that the staff does not equally represent the people who are incarcerated here because there for the whole 18 years I've been in prison I've only seen one person of color who held a caseworker title. Caseworkers are essential to our reentry process, and who also sit on classification boards that have to do with our transfers to lower security. And if I'm being real with you all of these white male caseworkers that are present here at Concord are terrible. There's definitely a lot of more favoritism that's given to white inmates when resources are distributed. When I use to go to access hour (which is a opportunity to talk to administrative figures within the institution) there were never people of color in any of those positions, and if there was they probably occupied those positions for such a short period of time that there presence was not felt here. I've also been told by people here that women who have worked for mental health services speak of this institution being a toxic work environment. On top of that, I NEVER see people of color who are mental health clinicians. Especially, black men or women. I've seen sprinkles of Hispanic and Asian clinicians, but never black.
          <br><br>
          What does your day to day look like?
          <br><br>
          To keep it concise, the gym is closed because of covid, but they allow us to go to the yard everyday here. They let us out for rec in the morning from 9 to 11. We come out again in the afternoon from 1 to 4:30, and then they let us out from 6 to 9 at night. Most of my time is usually occupied though because I'm in one of the college programs that they have here. So I have classes Mon, Tues, and Friday morning from 8:30 to 10:40, classes every afternoon from 1 to 3:45, and one class at night on Thursday's from 6:30 to 8:20. Also I work in the kitchen seven days a week from 1 to 6:30, so as soon as I get out of school at 3:45 i go straight to the kitchen. Right now I'm taking five classes in total because two of our classes from last semester over lapped into this semester. We usually only do three classes at a time, but we had to make up for classes that we missed because of quarantine lockdowns. The classes are Sociology of Law, Genetics, Gender studies, Acting Shakespeare, and The Bible as Literature. Shit is real right now. I'm memorizing a monologue from Hamlet that I have to perform in front of my classmates in two weeks, I'm thinking of ideas for my gender studies final because she's making us write our own individual feminist manifestos, I have a genetics midterm that I am not optimistic about :), and for the sociology class I have to come up with a presentation for "legal cynicism". So most of my focus is on trying to keep up with the overwhelming workload of schoolwork in the midst of this pandemic.
          <br><br>
          Do you have full access to the medications that you need?
          <br><br>
          I don't take medication for anything in here. I'm one of those people who tries to find natural remedies for whatever illnesses I may be dealing with.
          <br><br>
          <br>
          What are you allowed to have with you in your cell? 
          <br><br>
          <br>
          Since I'm in a medium security prison I'm allowed to wear regular clothes like jeans and button ups, so believe it or not being able to wear regular clothes has a major effect on an individuals psyche in here. In maximum security you can only wear green or grey scrubs so there's a big difference. I've heard a lot of people express how happy they were to be able to wake up and throw on a pair of jeans. We are also able to buy or own TV's, fans, two pairs of headphones, and tablets. On the tablets they charge us $3 if we want to order a movie, $3 if we want to buy a game, $1.85 if we want to buy music, and 25¢ if we want to send out an email. Oh and all the ebooks on the tablets are free. What I find funny is that all of the ebooks on the tablet are free. The music, movies, and games all come at a cost but the knowledge is free. The kicker is that I know for a fact that there's only a very very small percentage of people in here who have actually downloaded the ebooks. Some of these dudes don't even know we can ordered books on the tablet. I remember on person even laughing at me for even insisting that he order one of the free books. The books that that they have on there are good too. The last one I read is The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. I think the books are free because they calculated that not many people would be interested in buying them. Most of the books are literary classics though (Up From Slavery, The Souls Of Black Folk, Uncle Tom's Cabin, different writings from Edgar Allan Poe, and Shakespeare). Its all knowledge whatever way you look at it though. If we order books physically we can have as many as we want in our cells. The rules say that we're only allowed ten books, but that's one of those rules that they don't really enforce. So as a result I have at least forty books in my cell right now. I'm an avid reader so I literally have books every where. Oh, and people who are fortunate enough in here are allowed to go to canteen for $75 dollars a week if they can afford it. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Do you live by yourself or with someone else? How does that impact you?
          <br>
          <br>
          Seeing that this is a medium security prison there are no single cells here. The only way a person can be granted single cell status is if they are a severe mental health case, a transgender, or if they have serious medical issues. Besides that everyone in here has a cell mate. I don't mind really mind having a cellmate because if you get a good one than that just means you have someone that you can bounce your ideas off of or build with whenever your need some type of intellectual stimulation. Its sucks when you have a cellmate who believes that you're here for the sole purpose of their entertainment. I hate people like that. Those are the people who constantly disrupt you from your peace of mind because they're afraid of being left alone with their own thoughts. Being left alone with their truth means that they have to live with, acknowledge, or accept the reality that they have created for themselves. A single cell is definitely much more enjoyable, but living with different cell mates is teaching me how to deal with the different personalities ill be forced to interact with. So I see having a cellmate as just another exercise because it allows me to see where I'm at with my conflict resolution skill and patience.

          Ahmed’s questions;
          If someone is losing their mind in solitary confinement who helps them?
          <br> 
          <br>
          Technically if they choose to they can receive help from mental health services, but like I said before not a lot of people that I associate with rely on them. Most of us feel like there's a disconnect between "them" and "us" which makes it impossible for us to open up to any of them. I personally don't feel comfortable divulging anything personal because I know nothing I say to these mental health clinicians is confidential. For me, that's the biggest deterrent. I don't want something I say to them to ever be used against me later on down the line, so I feel more comfortable dealing with my issues myself. I feel like we are all de facto therapist in a way. Of course we obviously don't specialize in the psychiatric fields, but "misfortune forms the education of intelligence" sometimes (this is literally a quote that I have posted on my wall). So I honestly do feel like I'm qualified to talk people through their issues sometime. I don't need a degree to know how to talk my friends off a ledge. Sometimes they just need advice or insight from an individual that they can relate to, and the community that we've built amongst ourselves allows us to feel safe opening up to  one another.
          <br>
          <br>

          What excites you most about being released from prison?
          <br>
          <br>

          What excites me most is that I have the opportunity to walk out these doors one day. I recognize that this is an opportunity that a high percentage of people in here will probably not have the privilege of doing, so I'm grateful more than anything else. I come from a family of seven where I grew up with my mother, my stepfather, my two sisters (one older and one younger than me), and my two older brothers. Both of my older brothers ( one killed at the age of 19 and the other killed at the age of 27) were murdered due to the gang violence that we all perpetuated, so in acknowledging the chaos and hurt that we've all individually caused I feel compelled to do better now. Of course, I'll forever feel like there's a debt that has to be paid because of the crime that I  committed. With that in mind, all I can do is do everything in my power to become a better man. I feel like the majority of the men in my family have fell victim to the statistics that prophesized our demise. Now that I have this second chance at life I'm walking with the spirit of my brothers, my father (who died of HIV), and my grandfather who all died to soon and never got to experience this life for what it really is. Those are the thoughts that I wrestle with in here when I think about coming home next year. I think to myself, "How can I be influential to my family and community in a positive way to bring about some type of change—even if its incremental?". I have pictures of people like Nipsey Hussle, Brian Stevenson, Colin Kaepernick, Chadwick Boseman, and Muhammad Ali to keep me motivated, and to remind me that it will not be easy. I think I'm mostly exciting about following through with this educational track that I'm on though. Mainly because there are so many naysayers in here who believe that its impossible. They don't believe that people like us (felons) can succeed in the academic field because of a self-defeating mentality that they have internalized. So I would honestly love to be the example of what "could" be. The example—that shows other individuals in here that it is possible despite what some may believe. It is my dream to disprove their belief, and you have no idea how motivated I am to do so. I think this burning desire to succeed comes from the fact that I now know its possible. On a lighter note, I'm excited about being able to see all the Rated R comic book movies that they've come out over the last 18 years with because were not allowed to watch Rated R movies in here, so I've been dying to see movies like Resident Evil 2,3&4, Deadpool 1&2, Logan, and The Joker. And I'm definitely gonna be binge watching rap battles on YouTube from old Smack DVD's and the URL (I think its stands for Underground Rap League).

          What are your opinions on Restorative Justice? Do you think it would be an effective strategy to use in the criminal justice system?
          <br>
          I've actually participated in a 33 week Restorative Justice program that they had here, and I feel like it was one of the best programs that this institution had to offer. Its a tough program because it deals with repairing whatever harm the offender may have cause within his or her community. The exercises throughout the program focused on not only the crime, but the also the upbringing of individuals to get a better understanding of how our circumstances came to be. It was tough at first sharing some of my personal experiences in those circles because these were all individuals that I only knew on a surface level. After a while their was a little camaraderie that we developed amongst each other. I felt like I could be honest with the individuals in that circles because there was times when people bared their souls. There's a phase where we had to write a letter to someone who may have harmed us, and then we had to write a letter to someone that we have harmed. When it came time for us to write the letter to someone who had done harm to us I wrote the letter to my mother, and vented to her about the ill feelings that I had towards her that i had been harboring. That's when I feel like I had one of my breakthrough moments in that program because it helped me gather the courage to address an issue between me and my mother that could no longer be Ignored. Once I got to tell my mother how I really felt about certain things, and she listened with a genuine ear it changed our relationship because she accepted responsibility for the harm that had caused to me. Our relationship is great now because of it. In the third phase of that program we did a Victim Impact Panel and that's when the mother of a victim of homicide came in and told us about the experience of her son being murdered. It was an eye opening experience for all of us because we all got hear about the affects of a crime similar to all of our own. Even though none of us were locked up for the murder of her son we are all still here for killing someone else's son, so we know the pain that she expressed had to be no different than the victims families of our own cases. That's why her words were so impactful to us. Having this discussion with her made me go back and talk my own mother so I can hear how she felt about the losses of my brothers. Its a discussion that I'd never really had with her up until that point because I was never really good with dealing with those types of emotions, but soon as I started to question her about how she felt about my brother Cassim's murder she immediately became overwhelm with emotion. I was asking her does she think she would ever be able to forgive the person who murdered him and she said that she's still working on but she's just not there yet. One of the main things she said to me that stuck with me that day though, is that she will probably die with a broken heart. Hearing those words tore me apart on the inside because i knew for a fact that there was nothing i could say or do to change that. But hearing that from my own mother allowed me to be able to empathize with the family of the victim in my case. I don't think I would've been able to reach these points without Restorative Justice. The last phase of the Restorative Justice program here was the Accountability Circle, and its the toughest part of the program. Its when you describe whatever crime you are here for in detail, and then everyone in the circle gets to comment or question why you did what you did. Questions like: What you could have done better to prevent the crime?, Who else do you think was affected by your crime besides the victim and the victims family?, or Identify the emotions that you felt when the crime was committed. Sometimes the questions are even more intrusive than that. Even though it feels interrogative to an extent its more about challenging individuals to repair harm and take responsibility for whatever they may be here for. I understand why people are reluctant to sign up for RJ too. Its difficult for people to open up and be vulnerable like that in front of a group of men that they don't know from a hole in a wall. Being vulnerable like that takes a level of courage that not a lot of men in here possess, so I know its not for everyone. Participating in that program has helped me immensely though. I feel like its one of those programs that everyone should do though because I belief if taken seriously by its participants that program can create real change. Unfortunately its not a program that's available to every institution. I was here at MCI Concord for 4 years before they actually brought it here. It will probably be a little while before the allow that program back at this institution especially  with covid and everything going on out there right now. As far as it being utilized in the criminal justice proceeding if the victims of the crime was ever open to it than I think it should definitely be available for them to use as an alternative punishment. Maybe that will put a dent in the 2.3 million people incarcerated within the United States. Who knows?

          How do others feel about your ability to vote? Do they consider to be important, a luxury?
          <br><br>
          Honestly, not a lot of people care to vote because they don't understand how politics work. Its their ignorance that prevent them from caring about why their vote or opinion matters? A lot of us are under educated so we don't even understand the basics of how congress works. We only learn about the laws that we attend to break just so we know how to defend ourselves in court when the time comes. Most of us have experienced being disenfranchised, but a lot of us don't even understand what disenfranchisement is and how these structures have been implemented to assure our downfall. I'm not saying I agree with this ignorance that some people are unconsciously proud of, but I'm saying that's the reality of our situation. I'm another person who was skeptical about voting until I participated in EI and they paired me with a someone who was instrumental in my learning process so initiatives like EI definitely make a difference. The person they paired me with was perfect because whenever I had questions for anything she sent me so much information on the subject that it sometimes overwhelmed me. It helped with my understanding of things like the wealth tax, red lining, the absurd deficit of student debt that this country sweep under the rug, and background information on candidates that I didn't really have access to. All of that was essential. I wish it was something that everyone in here could experience, but I know their resources and the people willing to participate at limited so we just have to be grateful for what is. One thing that someone pointed out to me is that the only people willing to donate their vote tend to be people who lean more towards the liberal side, so I was love to see them encouraging or recruiting people with more conservative views. Even if we aren't able to see eye to eye there's still something to be learned from those dialogues whether it be positive or negative.

          How much access to the news is available to people in maximum security?
          <br>
          I personally haven't been in maximum security custody in six years, so I won speak on it because I know its not the same as when I last left it so Nigel would be more qualified to answer that question. But here in medium security, the basic television channels and news networks that we have are reliable resources. I get most of my everyday news from Good Morning America and NBCLX. Good Morning America covers almost everything, and NBCLX gives you the news through the lens of Millennials and Generation Z. The combination of those two news resources keeps me well informed. For newspapers, I have a friend that gets the Wall St. journal, so that is also a useful. To keep up with pop culture I make sure I watch TMZ, Dish Nation, Wendy Williams, and The Real religiously. We can also order magazines in here, but at one point in time the administration here wasn't allowing us to receive any "urban" (black) magazines so we couldn't get Hip-hop Weekly, XXL, Smooth, or Vibe magazine because they were always conveniently deemed a some type of "security threat". But when it came to magazines like the Rolling Stone, People, Us weekly, Esquire, or Maxim those publications are let in the institution with a hiccup. Its blatantly discriminatory, but when you bring it to administrations attention it still get swept under the rug. Lately they haven't been as strict with upholding these rules because I've been beginning to see different urban magazines floating around the prison. Magazines like SMM (Social Medium Magazine),  XXL, Kite magazine (the best magazine in my opinion), and other black magazine that I haven't seen in years are floating around now. So those magazines are instrumental in keeping us in tune with the culture. That may seem frivolous to people on the outside looking in, but to us small things like that are everything.

          How do you decide who to vote for from jail? What information goes into your decision?
          <br><br>
          Fortunately through Emancipation Initiative I was paired with a person who kept me well informed throughout the primaries whenever I was confused about an issue. What I can tell you is that I definitely did not vote for Trump :) I couldn't see myself under any circumstance voting for that dude, so I went wit Joe Biden and Kamala. I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of Kamala Harris because I know she was the Senator of a state that champions the death penalty. Plus, I know she was also a district attorney so I doubt that she was doing things within the justice system to attack things like mass incarceration and other inequities that exist within the system. Joe Biden was my choice, but most would say that he was only my choice of a lesser evil. When I picked who I wanted to vote for I thought a lot about immigration policies, prison reform, and student debt. That last election left a sour taste in my mouth though. It felt like I was watching a political reality show right before my eyes. It felt like one big joke to me. It was the first time I got to see white supremacy play out right in front of my eyes. Things like voter suppression, the whole social justice movement that played out in the middle of election season, and a commander in chief who incited an insurrection and then walked away from it free of consequence.

          Do you believe that people who are incarcerated should be given more opportunities to learn about what's going on in the outside world?
          <br><br>
          I think there should be a lot more opportunities for us to learn about whats going on out there because I always preach to individuals in here how important it is to stay in tune with whats going on in the real world. I know some people that are so detached from the real world that they have no idea how hard its going to be for the to adapt when they do finally get out. Things like these programs in here where we interact with different volunteers from the streets is what keeps us on point and in tune with the current culture, so I don't believe that these opportunities to grow should be suppressed in any way.</div>
