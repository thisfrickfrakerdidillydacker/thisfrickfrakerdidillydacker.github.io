From Kyron<br>
<br>
Answers-<br>
To Abigail and Grace:<br>
<br>
Q: How has being incarcerated affected your mental health?<br>
<br>
A: Prior to coming to prison I suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from witnessing domestic violence in my home. Prison has affected and exacerbated my PTSD from the very inception of my incarcerated. For example, when I got arrested in 2007 at the age of eighteen years old I was sent to Dartmouth House Of Corrections (DHOC). At the DHOC I was given a prison uniform an exchange for my street clothes as well as a number for my name. This exchange was the beginning of the stripping of my dignity and self identity which worsen my struggle with preexisting trauma.<br>
<br>
Q: Have you received any mental health support while incarcerated? <br>
<br>
A: yes, but the mental health support that I received was menial.  Here (MCI Concord) Mental Health Services is mediocre because the majority of the D.O.C.'s budget goes to security which leaves services like mental health understaffed and depressed.<br>
<br>
Q: How many people would you say you have met  while incarcerated that suffers from mental illness? <br>
 <br>
A: While there are a lot of known cases of mental illness among the incarcerated, I prefer to reframe your question and speak in terms of incarcerated peoples' unaddressed and devalued traumas. The reason why I reframe the question in these terms is because I feel like the majority of incarcerated people have suffered trauma prior to, and during, their incarceration, and unresolved and devalued trauma affects one's mental health. In this way, I can speak to the state of incarcerated people's mental health as a oppose to nonclinical diagnoses of mental "illness" per se.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What do you think would be a better alternative for people who suffers from mental illness rather than going to jail?<br>
<br>
A: I would have to say to reallocate government spending back to social welfare programs, while simultaneously, removing the stigma of social welfare programs and to teach our society that such programs are mechanism for social mobility for our most disadvantaged citizens. In particular, spending should go back to schools, because schools are the second primary place where children learn to know and be in the world.<br>
<br>
Q: Have you had any interaction with the crisis intervention Teams while incarceration?<br>
<br>
No, but l know people who have, and I believe  the philosophy of the Department Of Corrections (D.O.C.) is to park the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff instead of the top of the cliff, meaning instead of implementing policies to prevent certain things from happening their implementation is for after things happen.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you believe you and other people who are incarcerated would benefit from regular therapy or counseling if you do not already have it? <br>
<br>
<br>
A: I believe it will ameliorate certain aspects of the prison environment, but there is so many overlapping issues that goes unaddressed in here that will overshadow things like regular counseling and therapy. <br>
