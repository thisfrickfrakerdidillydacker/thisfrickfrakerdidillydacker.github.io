<h4>The following is a prisoners uncensored unedited awnsers to questions posed by students learning about the prison system. 
<br>
I hope reading this will show the huaminty, intelect, value, and redeemabilty of those contained within our prisons as it did for me.<br>
</h4>
Hello Abigail and Grace<br>
-How has being incarcerated affect your mental health? <br>
- being incarcerated has affected my mental health more adversely than not. I say this because of the way the prisons are designed; there are no checks and balances in place to prevent and hold accountable those individuals who would go out of their way to make a prisoner miserable. This kind of creates a subconsciousness that everyone in a uniform is against You. Here in a place where everything is repetitive, things start to become so sort of programming or training. It becomes something being instilled in you.      All at the same time I try extremely hard to remain positive, and that creates an opportunity to strengthen your mental health. However please note that many prisons are not so fortunate to have people in the free world in their corner the way that Ms. FitzGerald is there for me. For some, under these circumstances, I've watched them lose touch with reality.
<br><br>
-Have you received any mental health support while incarcerated? <br>
- I have tried to seek mental health (mh) assistance in the past. At times I've been completely ignored. Other times I was able to speak with mh staff and that would pretty much be the end. Not quite what I was seeking, however I can see how "a conversation" could be helpful to some prisoners. I've  requested records of what notes were taken by the mh staff and have found that the more impertinent issues were omitted. I'm unsure if it is by design or by coincidence. But I'm willing to put my money on the former.<br><br>

-How many people would you say you have met while incarcerated that suffer from mental illness? <br>
- too many! At least %10. And I've been in 16yrs so go figure.<br>

-What do you think would be a better alternative for people who suffer from mental illness rather than going to prison or jail?<br>
-  treatment centers with a more community base operation. I think all prisons should be ran this way however. Not just for those suffering from mental health. This is because everyone who is suffering wasn't always suffering. At times some prisoners just as witty and full of life as you could imagine have become mentally unstable through time.<br><br>

-Have you had any interaction with Crisis Intervention Teams while incarcerated? <br>
I have not no. But there is a process prior to a tact team being administered where mental health has to clear them to attack you. I have been in this situation once. This day in particular I was falsely accused of threatening an officer whom I had written a few complaints on for misconduct. I was then brought to various parts of the prison and repeated strip searched. After complying with 2 strip searches and 2pat searches, officers attempted to strip me yet again. Each time that I was searched I was immediately placed into handcuffs and thus no justification for another search. The last time I refused and I was going through the process of speaking with mental health prior to being cleared for the tact team being administered. I was trying to explain to her that I had being stripped and searched 4 times each time on camera and that I should not have to be searched again. She merely kept repeating her question to me "are you going to comply with the strip search?" No matter what I said to her she disregarded and repeated her question. There was no understanding no checks and balances to verify whether or not my claims were valid or could be confirmed via the video surveillance etc. I was then force stripped where officers cut all the clothes off my body and searched me.<br><br><br>


-Do you believe you and other people who are incarcerated would benefit from regular therapy or counseling if you do not already have it?<br>
-Yes I believe all prisoners would benefit from regular therapy and counseling. Absolutely we would!<br>
----------------<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Leo<br>
- How are people of different demographics treated differently? (race, gender, lgbtq, religion, etc)<br>
-  I would say that people of different demographics are treated differently. This is done by classification to lower security housing placement, program acceptance, work/job placement acceptance, answers to staff complaints via the grievance process, visiting scrutiny, and receiving parole.<br>
<br>
- do the staff and guards represent the identities of the people who are incarcerated?<br>
-  Absolutely not. While you see more colored officers and staff today, there is still far less colored officers and staff than are colored inmates. While colored inmates represent the majority of inmates, the Caucasian race represents the majority of officers and staff whom work within and for the DOC.<br>
<br>
- What does your day-to-day look like?<br>
-  my day to day is filled with cell time. I'm only allowed outside my cell 21 hours a week. And that's max. But usually it will be less than that. I try to stay to myself and learn the laws of the land so that I can effectively challenge some of the issues within the criminal justice system. I haven't been to a yard or gym in almost a year and a half due to retaliatory circumstances by the DOC staff. (you can verify this retaliation by going on line and looking up Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center; January 2020, brutality. We were forced to sue and even attorneys were forced to file suit with the court to gain access to their clients because the institution would not allow attorneys to visit their client. The court ordered things which still have not been complied with all this time later.)<br>
<br>
- do you have full access to the medications you need?<br>
- we do not have full access to the medication we need. Often we have to continuously file slips with a $3.00 fee. And we will be called for check ups sort to speak. And it's rare that we speak to providers or those able to prescribe medication.<br>
<br>
<br>
What are you allowed to have with you in your cell?<br>
Depending on where you are housed, we are able to have a TV, radio, tablet, a fan, typewriter, 10 books max, hygiene products, limited clothing and footwear, certain board games, legal work, personal letters and pictures, and food.<br>
<br>
Do you live by yourself or with someone else? How does that impact you?<br>
- I have lived with my cellmate for the past 8 months. Majority of my 16 years I have been forced to live with a cellmate. This is very disturbing. We are forced to live in bathroom sized quarters as it is. Then we also have the toilet in our cells which either of us must use when necessary. And let's face it, who would want to be around anyone while they are using the toilet. Whether you are the one using it or not. There's a major privacy breach. Having to smell another mans body throughout majority of the day, or listen to them yelling out the door or screaming songs etc, as you are trying to concentrate on important things to you, is a terrible way to live. You may be cooking or eating and suddenly his bowels need moving, or gas is passed. You may want to wake up early while the unit is sleeping and its quite enough for you to study and focus. Yet your cell mate is sleeping so you can not use the light without offending him or disrupting his sleep. You may want to clean while he is busy working. It upsets me to have to share such a small space and be without privacy for so much of my life. This prevents me from getting to know myself better as well as bettering myself on a spiritual and educational level. I think its by design though, like why else when there are enough cells to house  everyone separately, during a pandemic mind you, would they force us to live in a cell with one another? It impacts me negatively.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Ahmed<br>
<br>
If someone is losing their mind in solitary confinement who helps them?<br>
- If someone is suffering from mental health issues anywhere, we will fill out slips for them and sign their name. We can not do anything on someone else's behalf so we must circumvent the practice to get them help.<br>
<br>
What excites you most about being released from prison?<br>
-  the ability to do for myself. In here there is not much that prisoner can do without the hell from someone in the free world. We are not given jobs that pay to take care of our hygiene, buy clothing, food, make phone calls, send emails and letters, etc. Our jobs pay $1 a day and will only be allowed to spend half of it. The other half is to be saved until we're released. But $3.50 a week is nothing when everything is so expensive. One 20 minute phone call costs $2.00. Never mind any hygiene.<br>
<br>
More about solitary confinement...<br>
<br>
I believe the issues around solitary confinement are the amount of hours spent inside of the cell alone.  i.e. only 7 hours out of cell time per week max. For me, alone time is necessary. But solitary confinement is usually a sentence for a long period of time. For Years! And that can be very damaging to a persons mental health. There was many prisoners who would just talk aloud to themselves. They'd always dialogue as if they were two different people. Also people would just scream at the top of their lungs (e.g. "cockle doodle doom" every hour on the hour, etc.) They'd play with and smear their own feces, hang themselves, cut then own wrists and other vital areas of their bodies. At times they'd be beaten by officers in blind spots, skipped during meals (we are delivered out meals and served through a a lot cut off of a section of the cell door), and have no one to complain to. I'm speaking of an older time as well while I was there so things may have changed. But the madness will always exist. Before leaving your cell to go anywhere you are strip searched and then hand cuffed and shackled and escorted by two or more officer to your destination. You are only allowed 10 books max, extremely limited hygiene products (i.e. no lotion, hair products, soap etc). We get to earn a walkman radio, 1 (20min.) phonecall and 1visit (to be used during the month) after the first thirty days; and then 2 each (calls and visits) and a TV the end of 60 days; and then 3 calls an visits after 90 days; and 4 each after 120day. If you stay any longer, then the  remainder of your stay it stays at 4each max. But if an officer doesn't like you he can simply write a report stating that you broke a rule and they take your TV, radio, phonecalls and visits and that process explained above starts all over again. 120 days before you're allowed the ma calls and visits allowed. We are allowed to clean our cells one a week and only given showers 3x a week. There is a cart which comes by with books on it but are never updated. Religious staff are able to walk by and check on you once a week under harsh scrutiny, nurses come 3x a day under the same harsh scrutiny. Visits are only behind glass (i.e. non contact) there's more but I don't want to further the delay with the other students' questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
-What issues are most important to you when you’re deciding who you want to vote for?<br>
- issues that are most important to me are policy changes which affect the process of holding officers accountable for their careless slaying of Black and colored Lives. Recently in Minnesota a friend of mine was killed. They showed the bodycam video on the news. I just did years with my friend Marvin Vega and despite what they say, he was a happy soul. I don't know if he was on drugs or intoxicated during that incident but I feel like that video was shown to justify the fact that he was killed. My issu eis he had a knife. Is there any chance he could have suffered a leg wound and or arm wound before the decision to shot him in his chest was made? Does police enforcement always have to mean a loss of your life? My friend was killed by the police and over 10 years ago his little brother was also killed by the police. His mother lost both her children to police enforcement. How could this be. Its a very sad story and the irony of it all is no one here ever wants to return to this. This is not due to rehabilitation. This is due to the torture suffered while imprisoned.    People use words like, incarceration or correctional facility.  But to us these words are misused and borderline disrespectful. We call this place prison and ourselves prisoners and our sentences imprisonment. This is because those other words are only being used to mask what actually goes on in here. Us prisoners have made up our mind long before we're released that we are not coming back. While some of us will execute that statement like Big Brother Diamond does speaking up and being some what of an activist, other such as Marvin may not be equipped to do work as well as Diamond and will do something totally different but really it shouldn't have cost his life. The system often fails us all. You, all of whom  believe this is a working system, paying with your taxes to keep these places we call hell running; and us who see first hand that not only is it not a working system, but it never will be. All while I didn't intend to make this so one sided, for over a decade, most of the time. . . that's all I see!<br>
<br>
<br>
-Do many other people in Souza Baranowski want to vote? <br>
If not, why don’t they want to vote?<br>
- I'm sure that many other prisoner would like to vote. However, many of us including myself do not quite understand how it all works. And majority of us believe that our votes don't matter. I believe some form of education on the process of it all, preferably a simplified version so that they can see more clearly as to how it all works, an well have many more voters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-Will you vote when you get out of prison?<br>
-Will you be eligible to vote?<br>
- I believe that prisoners' voting rights are restored once they're released and if so, I absolutely will be voting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Alex,<br>
<br>
-How do others feel about your ability to “vote?” Do they consider it to be important, a luxury? <br>
This question, to me, can be interpreted a couple ways. That said please bear with me. When you ask "how do others feel" I don't know whether to take that as others who are locked behind the wall with me or others who are in the free world as if to graps my understanding of what "they '' feel? The latter I have never given much thought. However, thinking of it now I would imagine that most feel as though we should not have that right. And as for those of whom are here with me. I believe they don't have any particular feelings due to a lack of knowledge as to how it all works.
          You next you state "your ability to vote" which also confused me. If the "your" is my individual ability to work then I would say that not many know that I have the ability to vote. Those who do are more into politics while those who do not care less to pay attention to the opportunity.
           Those who know believe that we can really make a change through voting. And they feel as though I should make that choice to vote. And of course they inquire about how they may be able to cite as well.
            I hope that I answered your question effectively. If not then I apologize for my confusion.<br>

<br>
Hey Ruggero,<br>
-How much access to the news is available for people in maximum security? <br>
Well that depends on what kind of news access you're inquiring of. And it depends on which side of the prison you as housed at. If you are house on the north side, you are not allowed to have your own TV in your cell. Then, depending on what cell you as in and whether or not you can get the unit TV's changed to the news.  If you are housed on the green side and have purchased your own TV then you can watch whatever you want whenever you want. I personally watch the news all day with that luxury.<br>
          It also depends on whether or not the prisoner has the luxury of purchasing their own TV or having friends or family sending them a subscription of a newspaper etc.<br>
<br>
-How do you decide who to vote for from jail? What information goes into your decision?<br>
That's a great question. Sometimes it may be hearing about some of the things the candidates support as far as laws, etc. How I learned I had Ms. FitzGerald print me out some of the candidates' resume, sort to speak. And after reading about the candidates I was interested in I next had a dialogue with Ms. Fitzy about them and what they stand for, have supported in the past etc. I would like to know as much information as possible. But information about their character and their position on certain issues is mostly what goes into my decision.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Do you believe people who are incarcerated should be given more opportunities to learn about what's going on in the outside world
I absolutely believe that prisoners should have more opportunities to learn about what's going on in the real world. It is the deprivation thereof which cause prisoners to 
become mentally detached from reality. Why should the real world be hidden from us when prison is based on our rehabilitation? I mean afterall, many of us will be returning to society. I believe it best we do so with the best education and understanding about what's going on in the real world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Maddie,<br>
<br>
Great question. I think the most achievable legal change would be to reconstruct the law enforcing departments to have its officers and agents etc. submit to integrity verification. This can be done by mandating officers agents etc. to submit to a lie detector test geared toward verifying each individual employed by law enforcement is an officer of integrity. This to ensure that police officers, officers of the court, and corrections officers are not harboring some hate for those outside of their kind. This should be at the top of reconstruction. Firing those who fail and filling the necessary positions in order to keep order with the justice system.
       Longer aspects would be digging up old cases of people who were sentenced to life in prison or less by tainted officers of the court. And then having them set free.<br>
<br>
Ifrah,<br>
<br>
I love the concept of restorative justice. I feel like that is actually a working process. Because the system can pock criminals away all they want, but those victims of crimes may not forgive them nor actually begin their healing process. And without that, the perpetrators can not truly understand the gravity or their offense, nor begin its rehabilitation process.  I THINK IT WILL BE THE GREATEST, MOST IMPORTANT, AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO BE USED WITH IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM!!<br>
        However, please note that what I have learned about restorative justice involves the community, the victim and the offender together in a setting where the victim expresses how the offender made the victim feel. And what the victim expects the offender to do to begin and follow through with the victims healing and forgiveness process. This to me is the court room setting without the trial process, yet, with some form of the community enforcing the offender's accountability for its crimes.  Sadly, today's courtroom proceedings has become a stage to lawyers and district attorneys to flaunt these set of skills etc. rather than it being about the victims justice. This is why I agree with restorative justice and not merely the definition.com's definition of what restorative justice is.<br>

<br>
Hey  Kate<br>
<br>
Here is my answers to the students' questions. As stated before it will be difficult to have others answers these question if not on their own device. Maybe request the others on email and copy and paste the students' questions to them. I'm sure you will receive answers this way.<br>
<br>
I hope this into from me is of some help nonetheless. You take care out there.<br>
