          Hughes, Langston. Justice. 2003. Poem Hunter, www.poemhunter.com/poems/justice/.<br>
     Accessed 24 May 2021. <br> I used this poem to help inform my opinion on the concept of justice. it also lent me confodence throughout the porject knwoing that others had simalr perceptions of justice to me<br>

Kobielski, Lili, and Vera Institute of Justice. I Refuse for the Devil to Take
     My Soul. <br>
I used this book to write the poem “Redemption”.  It also helped inform my opinion on prison and prisoners. they all seemed so hopefull, so dignifed, even though hope and dignity were clearly things this system sought to deny them.<br>
<br>
Poem Searcher. www.poemsearcher.com/. Accessed 24 May 2021. <br>
I learned alot about the concept of prison wives from this site, it showed me the pain that imprisonment inflicts on a prisoner's loved ones. and how those realtionships don´t just stop loved ones will continue to wait and worry for the entire sentance.  I also collected some poems from here. <br>

<br>
Collected poems from this site. Also used to strengthen the power of poetry in fighting incarceration. it called atention to the inequity of cash bail as well as the har incarcertion inflicts on families <br>

Vaughn, Nigel. Interview. 4 May 2020.<br>
<br>
Was quoted in full to remind readers of the humanity of prisoners as well as shed light on how they see the world.  His obvios humanity and intelect, as well as the amount of effort he was willing to put into his writing goes a long way to shoing that, guilty or not prisoners are people who´s lives matter. <br>

Partial inspiration for poem seven times seventy. it shows the three strikes rule and the pain it causes while presnting it as a human rights whearas most paint it as a racial.(which it is as well) <br>
