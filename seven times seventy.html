         <h3> Seven times seventy:</h3>

You had caught him once, the law broken in his hands <br>
So You said to yourself<br>
To them <br>
To us<br>
He is guilty <br>
We are just <br>
<br>
we will cage him for a time<br>
To learn how to be free<br>
<br>
But you did not teach him how to be free<br>
And so he returned to you once more<br>
In chains, holding broken the law that you adore<br>
<br>
you told him “you disappoint me son”<br>
“But the mercy of justice is not yet done”<br>
we’ll cage you once more and once more you'll be freed <br>
Some time behind bars is just what you need”<br>
<br>
But no place was made for him outside of those bars <br>
So he returned, law broken in his arms <br>
And so you told him <br>
“You’ve broken our laws,<br>
So sacred and dear <br>
We’ll lock you away <br>
Forever I fear<br>
You can't be forgiven <br>
that much is quite clear”<br>
<br>
So you cast him away <br>
and forgot to which place <br>
And You said to yourself<br>
To them <br>
To us<br>
They were guilty <br>
We are just <br>
<br>
But this I say to you:<br>
What of the lord <br>
Could you not find it to forgive them once more?<br>
<br>
“Once more and once more oh where does it end?”<br>
At seven then seventy times again <br>
Then another, and some more <br>
<br>
So remember forgiveness <br>
you are drowning in gore<br>
<br>
