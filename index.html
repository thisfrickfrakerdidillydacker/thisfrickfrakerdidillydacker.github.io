        <p>So much of the discussion on the prison industrial complex is restatement of the same troubling statistics.  Like how despite only having 5% of the world's population america holds a quarter of the world's prisoners(washington post),  or how despite only making up 13% of americaâ€™s population african americans represent 40% of US prisoners.  ( U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics).  Or how 1 in 5 prisoners are incarcerated for nonviolent drug offences. (Ye Hee Lee)

If we were creatures of reason those numbers would be all that need to be said. But cursedly, blessedly we are so much more than that.  Those numbers for all their troubling implications mean next to nothing to many of us.  So here I have made something to speak to the heart.  I have compiled the personal stories of a number of prisoners, as well as poetry written by prisoners, their wives, and others who have felt the unwanted presence of the justice system in their lives, as well as some poetry of my own on the system's inherent imorality.  I hope that some of it means something to you</p>
