Your stone goddess stands so tall, <br>
Her eyes bound <br>
Claiming blindness,<br>
And yet she sees<br>
Ever so clearly <br>
Ones sins,<br>
As if they were written in blood on skin <br>
Of which she knows the color<br>
<br>
No, they are bound to hide <br>
The truth,<br>
The devil's eyes <br>
They see sins not as god does <br>
Not as falls to be overcome<br>
Not as tragedies to be freed from<br>
But as weights, to be tied to sinners and drag them to hell<br>
Pray to god or his absence that those eyes turn not upon your soul, <br>
For who could withstand the gaze of eternity?  <br>
Certainly not you<br>
<br>
<br>
