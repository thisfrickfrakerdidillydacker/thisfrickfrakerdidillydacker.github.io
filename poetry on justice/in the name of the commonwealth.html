          </h4><br>
          <br>
          In the CommonWealth's name <br>
You bind their sacred wings <br>
Making us the ones to blame <br>
<br>
You say itś justice but just the same <br>
The pain to them forever clings <br>
In the people´s name <br>
<br>
As you play your sacred game <br>
Caring not the pain you bring <br>
Making us the ones to blame <br>
<br>
The innocent and guilty you maime<br>
For justice? Your queen and king?<br>
In the CommonWealths name <br>
<br>
You cage them like animals to tame <br>
You keep them as if they were things <br>
Making us the one to blame <br>
<br>
You let them speak but just the same <br>
You blind our ears, don't hear them sing!<br>
In the CommonWealths name<br>
Making us the ones to blame <br>
<br>
<br><br>
<h3> Authors note:</h3>
<br>
<br>
When someone is tried for a crime in this country they are tried "In the name of the Commenweath".  The CommenWealth in this instsance refers to the state, as well as the people that reside within, meaning that any unjust ruleing is, as far as they are concered all of our faults as well as those more directly involved.  That is symbolicly sensible as by suporting the system and alowing it to continue we are passively condoneing the justice systems' crimes.
