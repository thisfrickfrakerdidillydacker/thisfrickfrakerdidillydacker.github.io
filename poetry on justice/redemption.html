<h3>Redemption:</h3><br>
<br>
They sit behind bars<br>
And say they’ve been given redemption<br>
They say it hurts, it’s hard<br>
But they’re glad they came here <br>
They’ll be better for this time<br>
When they leave they’ll get a job <br>
Beat their addictions <br>

But too often, too soon, once more,<br>
They sit behind bars<br>
and say they’ve been given redemption<br>
<br>
<br><br>
<h3> Authors note:</h3>
<br>
<br>
This poen was inspired by the book "I refuse for the devil to take my soul" by Lili Kobielski. It is a compolation of portrat photos of prisoners and interviews on thier situations and lives leading up to their 
imprisonment. While reading I was struck by thier hope, most said they would ever come back once they got out, and not one said they thought they would return, even though statistacly, more than half of them would. So I wrote a poem about that descrepency and how their hope is betrayed.
